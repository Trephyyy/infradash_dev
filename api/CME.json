Source is uncertain, with what could be an on-disk source that does not line up well when used in measurement. Observed well as field line movement over the SE limb in SDO AIA 171/193/211 starting around 2024-05-14T04:06Z. Additionally, a smaller C6.5 flare which peaked at 2024-05-14T04:08Z observed in SDO AIA 131 (this flare does not rise high above background flux, but is distinct in EUV imagery) lines up with this timestamp and the field line movement, but the source coordinates did not work well in swpc_cat triangulation to support it. It is possible that the source for this CME is on/just beyond the SE limb, supported by better triangulation at those longitudes.","submissionTime":"2024-05-14T19:43Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/30860/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2024-05-14T11:14Z","latitude":-24.0,"longitude":-90.0,"halfAngle":38.0,"speed":567.0,"type":"C","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Measurement at E90, not as plane of sky, but for good triangulation between SOHO and STEREO coronagraphs.

The clear source of this CME is an eruption starting around 2024-06-24T01Z off of or behind the SW limb and seen as an unusually long/persistant brightening off of the SW limb seen in AIA 131/335 between 2024-06-24T01Z and as opening  of field lines on/behind the SW limb in AIA 193/171 starting after 2024-06-24T01Z. The opening of field lines starts as relatively narrow but becomes wider after 2024-06-24T02Z and is followed by very high rising post-eruptive arcades seen  on/just behind the SW limb.

A dimming region possibly associated with a faint filament eruption is visible in SDO/AIA 193 starting around 2024-10-04T02:00Z in the SW near ARs 13842, 13839, and 13844 followed by moving/opening field lines visible in SDO/AIA 171 starting around 2024-10-04T03:00Z in the SW below ARs 13844, 13843, and 13836. The moving/opening field lines are largely visible heading to the west while the dimming appears to have some southern directionality. A third separate eruption from AR 13842 (an M4.0 flare) is likely associated with an overlapping CME feature.

A region of dimming is also visible to the North of this flare in SDO AIA 193 and STEREO A EUVI 195, which is indicative of a more Northern deflection.","submissionTime":"2024-10-14T12:59Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/33981/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2024-10-14T06:45Z","latitude":37.0,"longitude":78.0,"halfAngle":33.0,"speed":577.0,"type":"C","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Measurement based on source location and best fit between SOHO LASCO C2/C3 and STEREO A COR2","levelOfData":0,"tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2024-10-14T13:01Z","link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/33982/-1","enlilList":[{"modelCompletionTime":"2024-10-14T13:16Z","au":2.0,"estimatedShockArrivalTime":null,"estimatedDuration":null,"rmin_re":null,"kp_18":null,"kp_90":null,"kp_135":null,"kp_180":null,"isEarthGB":false,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/WSA-ENLIL/33983/-1","impactList":null,"cmeIDs":["2024-10-14T00:48:00-CME-001"]}]}],"linkedEvents":[{"activityID":"2024-10-14T00:04:00-FLR-001"}]},{"activityID":"2024-10-14T09:24:00-CME-001","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","startTime":"2024-10-14T09:24Z","instruments":[{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C2"},{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C3"},{"displayName":"STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2"}],"sourceLocation":"S30W70","activeRegionNum":null,"note":"CME first seen in the SW by SOHO LASCO C2 beginning at 2024-10-14T09:24Z, as well as by SOHO LASCO C3 and STEREO A COR2 in later frames.

There are a couple of possibilities for the source of this CME; however, the source most likely far-sided based on measurements. There is some faint field line movement best seen in GOES SUVI 284 from well beyond the NW limb a couple hours prior to the CME first becoming visible in STEREO A COR2. The measurement of the CME indicates that former AR 3875, which rotated off the Earth-facing disk on 2024-11-04, could be a good source candidate.","submissionTime":"2024-11-07T00:11Z","versionId":1,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/34480/-1","cmeAnalyses":[{"isMostAccurate":true,"time21_5":"2024-11-07T01:37Z","latitude":29.0,"longitude":121.0,"halfAngle":34.0,"speed":432.0,"type":"S","featureCode":"LE","imageType":"running difference","measurementTechnique":"SWPC_CAT","note":"Measurement based on the best fit between SOHO LASCO C3 and STEREO A COR2 imagery in SWPC_CAT.","levelOfData":0,"tilt":null,"minorHalfWidth":null,"speedMeasuredAtHeight":null,"submissionTime":"2024-11-07T00:13Z","link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CMEAnalysis/34481/-1","enlilList":[{"modelCompletionTime":"2024-11-07T00:42Z","au":2.0,"estimatedShockArrivalTime":null,"estimatedDuration":null,"rmin_re":null,"kp_18":null,"kp_90":null,"kp_135":null,"kp_180":null,"isEarthGB":false,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/WSA-ENLIL/34483/-1","impactList":null,"cmeIDs":["2024-11-06T20:23:00-CME-001"]},{"modelCompletionTime":"2024-11-07T01:21Z","au":5.5,"estimatedShockArrivalTime":null,"estimatedDuration":null,"rmin_re":null,"kp_18":null,"kp_90":null,"kp_135":null,"kp_180":null,"isEarthGB":false,"link":"https://webtools.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/WSA-ENLIL/34484/-1","impactList":null,"cmeIDs":["2024-11-06T20:23:00-CME-001"]}]}],"linkedEvents":null},{"activityID":"2024-11-06T23:36:00-CME-001","catalog":"M2M_CATALOG","startTime":"2024-11-06T23:36Z","instruments":[{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C2"},{"displayName":"SOHO: LASCO/C3"},{"displayName":"STEREO A: SECCHI/COR2"}],"sourceLocation":"S10E90","activeRegionNum":null,"note":"CME first visible to the E in SOHO LASCO C2 starting at 2024-11-06T23:36Z.

This CME fails before leaving the field-of-view of C2 and is covered by a data gap in STEREO A COR2. The source of this CME is most likely an M4.8 flare from AR 3947 (N15E26) that peaked at 2025-01-06T17:24Z. The flare and eruption can be seen in GOES SUVI 94, 131, 171, 195, 284, and 304. A subsequent EUV wave can be seen with slight eastward deflection in GOES SUVI 195 and 284.
